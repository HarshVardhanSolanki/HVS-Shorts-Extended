## 📖 Overview

Do you love watching YouTube Shorts but get frustrated when you can't easily rewind to catch a missed detail or fast-forward through a slow intro? **HVS Shorts Extended** is the ultimate lightweight Chrome extension that gives you back control of your viewing experience. 

By enabling seamless, precise keyboard navigation, you can easily skip forward or backward by exactly **3%** of the video's total duration using just your arrow keys.

## ✨ Key Features

* ⏩ **Precision Skipping:** Instantly skip forward or backward by exactly 3% of the Short's total duration.
* ⌨️ **Intuitive Navigation:** Just press the **Right Arrow (→)** to fast-forward and the **Left Arrow (←)** to rewind.
* 🎯 **Smart Typing Detection:** Arrow keys work normally when typing in the comments section or the YouTube search bar without accidentally skipping the video.
* 🎨 **Sleek Visual Indicators:** Features a native-looking circular UI indicator (**↻ +3%** / **↺ -3%**) that pops up smoothly in the center of the screen and fades away naturally.
* ⚡ **Zero Bloatware:** Designed to run silently in the background with zero impact on your browser's speed or performance.
